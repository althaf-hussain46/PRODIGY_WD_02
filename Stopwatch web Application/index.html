<!-- ðŸš€ Project Spotlight: Interactive Stopwatch Application
PRODIGY_WD_02: Prodigy InfoTech
Title: Creating Interactive Stopwatch Application with HTML, CSS, and JS


I'm excited to share my latest project â€“ a simple yet interactive stopwatch application designed with a focus on user-friendly functionality and a clean, intuitive interface. This application offers a seamless experience for anyone needing to track time precisely.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

HTML5: Structured content and layout definition.
CSS3: Styling elements for a responsive and visually appealing interface.
JavaScript: Adding interactivity and core functionality to the stopwatch.
âœ¨ Key Features:

Stopwatch Display

Dynamic display showing elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
Real-time updates as the stopwatch runs.
Control Buttons

Start: Initiates the timer.
Pause: Pauses the timer, allowing resumption later.
Reset: Stops and resets the timer to zero.
Lap: Records the current time as a lap, displaying it in a list.
ðŸ“‹ Detailed Breakdown:

HTML Structure (index.html): The backbone of the application, defining the stopwatch's structure using semantic elements. It features a main container for the stopwatch, a display for the time, buttons for control, and a list for lap times.
I invite you to explore this project and see how it can enhance your time-tracking needs with its simple, effective design. Feedback and thoughts are always welcome!
